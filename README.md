# VSoft.HttpClient

This is a simple Delphi wrapper over WinHttp. 

This project was created in support for the DPM project (ie needs to support XE2 or later), it's not well tested, so far I have only tested the functionality I needed. If you need a fully fledged well tested http client, I would recommend you stick with one of the more established libraries like Indy or ICS. That said, I would welcome contributions to flesh it out.

Supports canceling requests via VSoft.CancellationToken (dependency).

Works with Delphi XE2 or later.
